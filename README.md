Here are a few of my aplications made in C#

1.  "Serialization" is a program that takes an input xml file, that contains 4 people. Each having a name, an age and a country.
    Based on these informations, my app can read the xml and convert it into a list. That list can be searched, modified, added and removed elements from.
    At the end the program converts the list back into an output xml file.
    
2.  "UsersAPI" is a program that creates a database of users that is accesed through a RESTful API and applies CRUD operations on it.
